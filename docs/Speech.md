## 1️⃣ Elevator Pitch (45s – 1 min · ~120 words)

**Goal**
Create immediate impact, clarity, and curiosity. This is a _hook_, not a proof.

**Structure & guidance**

1. **Décor (10–15s)**
   - Who you are professionally, in one strong sentence
   - Your positioning, not your job title
     _“I’m a software architect focused on building human-centric, scalable platforms.”_

2. **Parcours (15s)**
   - One unifying thread of your background
   - Environments, types of challenges, not dates
     _“For 20+ years, I’ve worked at the intersection of technology, product, and teams in complex SaaS environments.”_

3. **Expertise (20s)**
   - 1 concrete example or result (compressed STAR)
     _“For example, I led the redesign of a high-traffic registration system used by millions of users.”_

4. **Project (10s)**
   - Where you are going, not what you want _from them_
     _“Today, I’m looking to apply this experience to products with real human impact.”_

5. **Question (5s)**
   - Open the conversation
     _“Does this resonate with what you’re building here?”_

## 2️⃣ Career Story (2–3 min · ~360 words)

**Goal**
Demonstrate coherence, depth, credibility, and motivation.

**Structure & guidance**

1. **Décor / Positioning (30–40s)**
   - Who you are as a professional
   - Your role in organizations
   - The recurring situations you thrive in
     _(Inspired directly by the document’s “planter le décor” section)_

2. **Parcours – the fil rouge (45–60s)**
   - Not “first I did…, then…”
   - Instead: 2–3 constants that define your journey
     Examples:
   - Type of environments (startups, scale-ups, regulated sectors)
   - Nature of problems (complexity, transformation, growth)
   - Your role (bridge-builder, expert, facilitator)

3. **Expertise – proof by examples (60–75s)**
   - 1–2 STAR stories
   - Focus on:
     - Problems you repeatedly solved
     - Skills you developed as a result

   - Show learning and progression

4. **Training & credibility (20–30s)**
   - Education, certifications, continuous learning
   - Mention only what supports your positioning

5. **Project – alignment with target (30–40s)**
   - What you want to continue doing
   - Why _this_ role / sector / company fits
   - Mirror their challenges (as in the UBS example)

6. **Me – human layer (optional, 15–20s)**
   - One personal element reinforcing a useful trait
     _(engagement, curiosity, balance, creativity)_

7. **Question / transition**
   - Invite dialogue, not validation

## 3️⃣ “Why Me?” Statement (1–2 min · ~240 words)

**Goal**
Answer implicitly: _“Why should we trust you for this role?”_

**Structure & guidance**

1. **Their problem (30–40s)**
   - Show you understand their challenges
   - Rephrase, elevate, contextualize
     _“Many organizations struggle to align technology, people, and delivery at scale.”_

2. **Your differentiating strengths (60–80s)**
   - 2–3 strengths maximum
   - Each illustrated by a short fact or example
   - Avoid generic traits (“motivated”, “dynamic”)

3. **Evidence & credibility (40–50s)**
   - Results, impact, recognition, patterns of success
   - Show repeatability, not a one-off success

4. **Fit & projection (30–40s)**
   - Why you are relevant _now_
   - How your strengths serve _their next chapter_

5. **Question / next step**
   - _“Would it make sense to explore how this could translate into your context?”_
