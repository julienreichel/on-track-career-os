# Feedback from betatester

## Upload in diffent language

Uploading a CV in french causes issues

- Text is not corect
- date not detected

ToDo:

- Add a layer that check the CV, then translate it if needed
- Add support for Experience without dates
- Add feedback to user in case of error

## Security

When data is generated by an LLM, it should be prrofed by the user before being saved in the DB

## Onboarding

- User wants to click on the action to do

## What happens after upload

- All experience are shown as work

## Action button

- At the bottom, not visible, need floating

## Loosing date on import

- User may click on settings, or other page while doing the import, and loose it all

## Stories

- When a user edit stories, an press back to stories, should go back to where they are comming from (full list, or experiences list)
- Avoid generating too many stories
- Do not allucinate when creating stories or KPI.

## Flow

- User uploaded job (in german) - Checked match -> Generated CV (the left)

## Profile

- Need to show a progress, and a guide when editing
