# Guide: How to Create a Strong Cover Letter

## 1. Purpose of a Cover Letter

A cover letter is **not a summary of the CV**.
Its role is to **connect the candidate’s background to a specific context** (a role, a company, a moment).

**Primary objective:**
👉 Make the reader want to start a conversation.

Implications:

- Select information; do not exhaustively list experience.
- Focus on relevance, not completeness.
- The letter must stand on its own, even if the CV is not read.

## 2. Core Structure: VOUS – MOI – NOUS

A strong cover letter follows a three-part logic.
This is not a stylistic choice; it is a **cognitive flow** for the reader.

### 1) VOUS — Employer Context (Start here)

**Question answered:** _Why this company / this role, now?_

Principles:

- Start with the employer, not the candidate.
- Identify **2–4 challenges, priorities, or tensions** the organization is facing.
- Show understanding of the context (market, growth, transformation, constraints).
- Interpret the situation; do not rephrase the job description.

Rules:

- No self-description in this section.
- No “I” statements.
- This is the **most important and longest** part of the letter.

---

### 2) MOI — Candidate Value (Proof, not claims)

**Question answered:** _What concrete value does the candidate bring to this context?_

Principles:

- Demonstrate fit using **examples**, not adjectives.
- Each example should follow a simple logic:
  - Context → Action → Outcome

- Focus on **impact for the organization**, not personal achievement.

Rules:

- Use 1–2 strong examples maximum.
- Avoid lists of tools, skills, or tasks.
- Avoid generic qualities (“motivated”, “dynamic”) unless proven by facts.

---

### 3) NOUS — Future Collaboration (Projection)

**Question answered:** _How could this collaboration realistically work?_

Principles:

- Project into the future without repeating the past.
- Describe how the candidate would contribute **in this specific context**.
- Focus on ways of working, priorities, and first areas of contribution.

Rules:

- Forward-looking only (no new achievements).
- Grounded in the company’s reality (team size, product, growth phase).
- Concise (this is not a second MOI).

---

## 3. Opening the Letter

- A generic introduction is optional and often unnecessary.
- A strong letter often starts **directly in the VOUS section**.
- The opening should capture attention by highlighting a relevant challenge or situation.

**Good opening mindset:**

> “Here is a problem or opportunity you care about.”

---

## 4. Closing the Letter

The closing should:

- Encourage dialogue
- Remain professional and measured
- Avoid emotional or exaggerated language

Best practice:

- Add **one sentence inviting discussion or exchange** (not excitement).
- Use a simple, professional sign-off.

Avoid:

- Overly formal or empty closings
- Generic enthusiasm (“excited”, “thrilled”, “passionate”)
- Pressure or entitlement

---

## 5. Tone and Style Guidelines

### Do:

- Keep it to one page
- Use short, readable paragraphs
- Write clearly and concretely
- Adapt every letter to the specific context

### Avoid:

- Repeating the CV
- Negative topics (failure, burnout, unemployment)
- Overconfidence or exaggerated claims
- Buzzwords, jargon, internal acronyms
- “Template” language that could apply anywhere
