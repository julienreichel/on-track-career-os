# 2. Core Philosophy

### ✔ AI should coach, not replace

The system guides users who don’t know how to express themselves — while keeping them in control. AI provides structure, suggestions, and feedback, but users validate and refine everything.

### ✔ Career growth requires clarity before action

Users first clarify identity, strengths, and direction before producing application materials.

### ✔ Job search is a strategic process

Success comes from alignment between:

- Personal strengths
- Career direction
- Company needs
- Market realities

### ✔ Feedback creates progress

The system doesn’t just generate outputs — it evaluates clarity, alignment, and impact, and guides users on how to improve.

### ✔ Everything connects

Identity → Career Targets → Experience Proof → Market Needs → Communication → Feedback → Iteration.
