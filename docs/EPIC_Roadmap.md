# 🧭 EPIC ROADMAP — AI CAREER COACH EDITION

Perfect — beta feedback is gold for shaping the landing. I went through it and several comments directly justify a **strong pre-login explanation layer**. Here’s how it informs the landing EPIC.

---

## 🧱 Landing EPIC Scope (Beta-Informed)

### 🔹 Hero Section

**Headline:**

> _Your AI Career Coach — from self-discovery to job offers._

**Subtext:**

> Stop guessing what employers want. Understand your value and present it with impact.

CTA:
**Start my career journey**

---

### 🔹 “How It Works” — Guided Journey (CRITICAL)

This directly addresses beta confusion.

**Section Title:**
**A step-by-step journey, not just a CV tool**

Visual flow:

1. **Discover your strengths & direction**
2. **Turn your experience into impact stories**
3. **Understand what employers really need**
4. **Create targeted CVs and letters with feedback**
5. **Prepare confidently for interviews**

This mirrors your actual system flow

### 🔹 “Built for Real Job Search, Not Just Documents”

Comparison block:

This reflects your strategic positioning section
