# ✅ MASTER PROMPT 1 — Implement STARStory Domain Layer

(Repository + Service + Composable)

### 1. CONTEXT

Backend is fully ready for STAR stories:

- Data model defined (STARStory entity with achievements & KPIs)
- AI operations implemented & validated (`ai.generateStarStory`, `ai.generateAchievementsAndKpis`)
- Experience model already exists and is stable.
  Frontend domain layer is missing for STAR creation, persistence, and editing.

### 2. COMPONENTS / COMPOSABLES

Create or use:

- `StarStoryRepository`
- `StarStoryService`
- `useStoryEngine()` (declared in Component Mapping)

### 3. PAGES INVOLVED

- `/profile/experiences/:id` (story entry point)
- `/stories/new` (guided flow)

### 4. IMPLEMENTATION INSTRUCTIONS

Implement the following methods:

**Repository**

- `getStoriesByExperience(experienceId)`
- `getStory(id)`
- `createStory(storyInput)`
- `updateStory(storyId, storyInput)`
- `deleteStory(storyId)`

**Service**

- `generateStar(sourceText)` → calls `ai.generateStarStory`
- `generateAchievements(starStory)` → calls `ai.generateAchievementsAndKpis`
- `linkStoryToExperience(storyId, experienceId)`

**Composable: `useStoryEngine()`**
Expose reactive state + actions:

- `stories`, `selectedStory`
- `loadStories(experienceId)`
- `createStoryDraft(experience)`
- `runStarInterview()`
- `saveStory()`
- `generateAchievements()`

Follow same architectural conventions as Experience/Canvas domain layers.

### 5. TESTING INSTRUCTIONS

- Repository mock GraphQL responses
- Service mock AIC calls (validate schema)
- Composable: state transitions, error states, loading states

### 6. ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA

- Domain layer fully operational
- Tests cover all methods
- `useStoryEngine()` is the **single API** used by all UI pages
- Zero UI implementation yet

---

# ✅ MASTER PROMPT 2 — Implement Experience List Page (`/profile/experiences`)

### 1. CONTEXT

This page already exists in minimal form per project status, but lacks:

- Entry points to STAR builder
- “Story status” indicators
- Navigation refinement
  See Component Mapping.

### 2. COMPONENTS TO USE

- `<UTable>`
- `<UButton>`
- Experience List Component

### 3. COMPOSABLES

- `useExperienceStore()`
- `useStoryEngine()`

### 4. IMPLEMENTATION INSTRUCTIONS

Modify the experience list to include:

- A “Create STAR Story” button per experience
- A “View/Edit Story” button if story exists
- A status chip:
  - `No story` (grey)
  - `Draft` (yellow)
  - `Completed` (green — has achievements)

- Support navigation to:
  - `/profile/experiences/:id/story`

### 5. TESTING INSTRUCTIONS

- Table renders correct actions
- Story status computed correctly
- Navigation triggers correct route

### 6. ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA

- User sees immediately which experiences need stories
- Table is clean, minimal, MVP-friendly
- No STAR logic here—only navigation

---

# ✅ MASTER PROMPT 3 — Implement Experience Editor + Achievements Generator

(`/profile/experiences/:id/edit`)

### 1. CONTEXT

Experience Editor exists but is missing integration with STAR story generation (achievements/KPIs).
See Experience model.
AI operation: `ai.generateAchievementsAndKpis`.

### 2. COMPONENTS

- `<UForm>`
- `<UTextarea>`
- `<UButton>`
- Achievements Preview Component (simple list)

### 3. COMPOSABLES

- `useExperienceStore()`
- `useStoryEngine()`

### 4. IMPLEMENTATION INSTRUCTIONS

Add button:

**“Generate Achievements & KPIs from STAR Story”**

- If no story exists → show modal “Create a STAR story first”
- If story exists:
  - Fetch it
  - Call `generateAchievements(story)`
  - Display achievements + KPIs in a preview panel
  - Allow “Apply to Experience” (optional field for MVP: add achievements into experience description or keep separate)

### 5. TESTING

- Button is disabled if no story
- AI call generates the expected arrays
- Preview renders correctly

### 6. ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA

- Editor supports generating achievements directly
- No story? → clean UX fallback

---

# ✅ MASTER PROMPT 4 — Implement STAR Story Builder Page

(`/profile/experiences/:id/story`)

### 1. CONTEXT

This is the **core** of EPIC 2.
Page description: Guided STAR interview, chat-like UI.
See page mapping: STAR Story Builder.

AI operations used:

- `ai.generateStarStory`
- `ai.generateAchievementsAndKpis`
  (Contract definitions: )

### 2. COMPONENTS

- `<UChat>` (custom chat UI)
- `<UTextarea>`
- `<UButton>`
- `<UModal>` for achievements preview

### 3. COMPOSABLES

- `useStoryEngine()`
- `useExperienceStore()`

### 4. IMPLEMENTATION INSTRUCTIONS

**Flow:**

1️⃣ **User starts by answering guided prompts:**

- “What was the situation?”
- “What was your task?”
- “What action did you take?”
- “What result did you achieve?”
  These prompts are not generated by AI — deterministic MVP flow.

2️⃣ **User submits all fields**

3️⃣ **Call `ai.generateStarStory`**

- Show loading indicator
- Populate story editor fields with response

4️⃣ **Ask: “Generate achievements/KPIs?”**

- If yes: call `ai.generateAchievementsAndKpis`
- Show preview in a modal
- User can accept → saved into STARStory entity

5️⃣ **User saves story**

### 5. TESTING

- Guided flow is deterministic
- AI operations called with correct payload
- Story saved correctly and linked to experience
- Achievements preview logic works

### 6. ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA

- Full guided STAR story builder
- Clean UX, minimalistic
- Story is persisted
- Achievements generated optionally

# ✅ MASTER PROMPT 7 — End-to-End Flow Tests

(“From Experience → STAR Story → Achievements → Save”)

### 1. CONTEXT

EPIC 2 must be validated end-to-end for MVP.
Project status shows no E2E tests yet.

### 2. REQUIRED E2E STEPS

Using Playwright:

1. User logs in
2. Goes to `/profile/experiences`
3. Opens an experience
4. Clicks “Create STAR Story”
5. Goes through guided inputs
6. Generates STAR story
7. Generates achievements/kpis
8. Saves story
9. Story appears in experience list with correct status

### 3. MOCKING

- Mock AI responses with known, deterministic STAR JSON

### 4. ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA

- Full workflow completes without errors
- Story persists after page reload
- Achievements visible in UI

# ✅ MASTER PROMPT 1 — Implement PersonalCanvas Domain Layer

(Repository + Service + Composable)

### 1. CONTEXT

The backend for EPIC 1B is fully implemented: GraphQL model, AI operation (`ai.generatePersonalCanvas`), repository/service/composable tests already exist (as per the project status).
BUT the **frontend domain layer is missing**: we need to expose the data to UI pages through clean composables, following your architecture.
See: high-level architecture and data model.

### 2. COMPONENTS / COMPOSABLES

Create or use:

- `PersonalCanvasRepository` (wraps GraphQL queries/mutations)
- `PersonalCanvasService` (business logic)
- `useCanvasEngine()` (exposes load/save/regenerate for UI)
  — already mentioned in Component/Page Mapping:

### 3. PAGES INVOLVED

None yet — this is backend/frontend domain foundation.

### 4. IMPLEMENTATION INSTRUCTIONS

- Follow existing patterns from Experience, STARStory, CVDocument.
- Implement in `/domain/personal-canvas/` folder.
- Methods:
  - `loadCanvas(userId)`
  - `saveCanvas(canvasInput)`
  - `regenerateCanvas(profile, experiences, stories)`

- `regenerateCanvas()` must call `ai.generatePersonalCanvas` using AIC contract.
- Ensure all types are imported from the Lambda re-export (single source of truth).
- Keep functions pure, TDD-first, max line thresholds respected.

### 5. TESTING INSTRUCTIONS

Create unit tests mirroring other domains:

- Repository: GraphQL calls, optimistic update.
- Service: correct merge/update logic; regeneration calls AIC with valid schema.
- Composable: state management + error states + loading states.

### 6. ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA

- All repository, service, composable functions implemented + tested.
- `useCanvasEngine()` exposes `canvas`, `loadCanvas()`, `saveCanvas()`, `regenerateCanvas()`.
- Calling `regenerateCanvas()` returns a validated PersonalCanvas JSON.
- No UI work yet.
- All tests pass.

---

# ✅ MASTER PROMPT 2 — Implement `/canvas` Page (View + Edit)

### 1. CONTEXT

EPIC 1B requires **a visual, editable canvas**. According to navigation + component mapping, this is page **1.5**.
See: Navigation and Component Mapping.

### 2. COMPONENTS TO USE

- **UI:** `<UContainer>`, `<UCard>`, `<UFormGroup>`, `<UTextarea>`, `<UButton>`
- **Custom components:**
  - `PersonalCanvasComponent.vue` (displays 9 sections)

- **Composables:**
  - `useCanvasEngine()`
  - `useUserProfile()`
  - `useExperienceStore()`
  - `useStoryEngine()` (for regeneration source data)

### 3. PAGE TO IMPLEMENT

- `/canvas` displaying:
  - All 9 fields:
    valueProposition, keyActivities, strengthsAdvantage, targetRoles, channels, resources, careerDirection, painRelievers, gainCreators
  - “Regenerate Canvas” button
  - “Save” button
  - Simple column layout (no drag & drop for MVP)

### 4. IMPLEMENTATION INSTRUCTIONS

- Load existing canvas via `useCanvasEngine().loadCanvas()`.
- If no canvas exists → display “Generate canvas” button.
- Editing uses `<UForm>` or inline `<UTextarea>` depending on simplicity.
- On save, call `saveCanvas()`.
- On regenerate, call `regenerateCanvas(profile, experiences, stories)` using data from composables.

### 5. TESTING INSTRUCTIONS

- Component tests:
  - Page renders 9 editable sections.
  - Buttons trigger composable functions.
  - Loading state displayed.

- Integration tests:
  - Mock composable return values.
  - Canvas persists after edit.
  - Regenerate replaces existing canvas content.

### 6. ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA

- Page loads existing canvas when user returns.
- Editing works for all fields.
- Regeneration uses latest profile/experience/story data.
- Responsive and minimal.
- No drag & drop (YAGNI).
- Adheres to Nuxt UI conventions.

---

# ✅ MASTER PROMPT 3 — Implement `<PersonalCanvasComponent/>`

### 1. CONTEXT

This reusable component is required for multiple views (future: versioning, matching explanations).
See architecture component list.

### 2. COMPONENTS TO CREATE

`components/personal-canvas/PersonalCanvasComponent.vue`

### 3. REQUIRED FEATURES (MVP ONLY)

- Display all 9 sections
- Editable mode using slots or props
- Optional read-only mode

### 4. IMPLEMENTATION INSTRUCTIONS

- Props:
  - `modelValue` (the full PersonalCanvas object)
  - `readonly`

- Emit:
  - `update:modelValue` for each field

- UI:
  - Wrap each section in `<UCard>` with `<UTextarea>` when editable.

- No drag & drop yet — too costly for MVP (YAGNI).

### 5. TESTING INSTRUCTIONS

- Test that each field renders.
- Editing updates modelValue via emitted event.
- Readonly mode disables inputs.

### 6. ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA

- The component is fully controlled via v-model.
- No business logic inside, only UI and events.
- Re-usable in future canvases.

---

# ✅ MASTER PROMPT 4 — Implement AI Regeneration Flow (Frontend)

### 1. CONTEXT

`ai.generatePersonalCanvas` is fully available and validated.
We implement its **frontend orchestration**.
See AI Interaction Contract.

### 2. COMPOSABLES

Modify `useCanvasEngine()` to:

- `async regenerateCanvas()`:
  - fetch profile (`useUserProfile`)
  - fetch experiences (`useExperienceStore`)
  - fetch stories (`useStoryEngine`)
  - call AI op with validated schema
  - save result to backend

### 3. IMPLEMENTATION INSTRUCTIONS

- Validate inputs before calling AI.
- Use existing Amplify GraphQL client with owner-based auth.
- Ensure loading/error states in composable state.
- Cache updated canvas in in-memory state to avoid re-fetch.

### 4. TESTING INSTRUCTIONS

- Mock AI operation (AIC schema).
- Tests for:
  - correct payload
  - missing data fallback
  - canvas gets updated
  - errors surface correctly

### 5. ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA

- Regeneration always produces a valid PersonalCanvas object.
- Works even with partial user data (AIC fallback rules).
- UI instantly displays the regenerated content.

---

# ✅ MASTER PROMPT 5 — Glue Navigation: Add Canvas Entry Point

### 1. CONTEXT

Navigation tree already defines the page.
See High-Level Navigation.

### 2. IMPLEMENTATION INSTRUCTIONS

- Add link to `/canvas` in:
  - Sidebar (“My Profile”)
  - Dashboard card (“Personal Canvas Status”)

- Indicate:
  - “Generated”
  - “Needs update” (use canvas.needsUpdate flag)

### 3. TESTING

- Click navigation → open canvas page.
- Status reflects `needsUpdate`.

### 4. ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA

- User can reach canvas page from ≥2 places.
- Status displayed correctly.

---

# ✅ MASTER PROMPT 6 — Implement E2E Canvas Flow (Minimal)

### 1. CONTEXT

EPIC 1B must be validated end-to-end.
See Project Status and roadmap dependency for EPIC 1B.

### 2. END-TO-END FLOW

1. User logs in
2. Profile filled
3. Experiences exist
4. User visits `/canvas`
5. User clicks “Generate Canvas”
6. Canvas is displayed
7. User edits → Save
8. Reload page → changes persist

### 3. TESTING INSTRUCTIONS

- Use Playwright minimal tests.
- Mock AI only if required by testing environment.
- Validate canvas is persisted in GraphQL.

### 4. ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA

- Canvas can be generated, edited, saved, reloaded.
- Zero console errors.

---

# ✅ MASTER PROMPT 7 — Implement “Canvas Weak Sections” Indicators (MVP-Lite)

### 1. CONTEXT

The EPIC mentions “AI suggestions for weak sections,” but fully implementing suggestions is NOT MVP.
We do a minimal display: weak sections = empty or too short.
(YAGNI: no AI improvement flow.)

### 2. COMPONENTS

Add small badges or warnings in `PersonalCanvasComponent.vue`.

### 3. IMPLEMENTATION

- Compute weak sections in `useCanvasEngine()` (pure function).
- Expose `weakSections: string[]`.
- Component shows small `<UBadge color="yellow">Needs attention</UBadge>`.

### 4. TESTS

- Test detection logic: empty, whitespace-only, or < 5 chars.

### 5. ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA

- MVP visual cue works.
- No AI calls triggered for this feature.
